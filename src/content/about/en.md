Hi, I'm **Akbar Ahmadi Saray** — a Senior Software Developer based in Urmia, West Azerbaijan, Iran, with over 10 years of experience designing and building scalable, secure software systems.

I specialize in **backend architecture**, **.NET Core**, **Node.js**, and modern design patterns like **DDD**, **CQRS**, and **Modular Monolith**. I've worked across the full development lifecycle — from requirements analysis and architecture design to implementation, testing, and production deployment.

## Experience Highlights

Over the years I've had the opportunity to work on some meaningful challenges:

- Built a **mission-critical enterprise portal** for the West Azerbaijan Bar Association serving 20,000+ active users across lawyer registration, case tracking, and financial workflows.
- Led the development of the **WA Nezam Welfare Portal** — a complex benefits management system handling loans, insurance, and fund management for lawyers and staff.
- Worked with an international team in **Istanbul, Turkey**, contributing to the **Tradiger** trading platform, collaborating across time zones and shipping high-stakes financial software.
- Created and published **Bonyan** — an open-source .NET library for Modular Monolith architecture that other developers use in their projects.
- Co-developed **Enter.UI** — a React component library based on Material Design principles.

## Research & Speaking

In **2024**, I presented research at the [ITNAF International IT Conference](https://itnaf.ir), sharing findings on software architecture patterns and their real-world applicability.

## Writing

I write about software architecture, backend engineering, and practical patterns — in both **English** and **Persian** — on this blog. My goal is to make hard concepts approachable for developers at every stage.

## Education

**B.Sc. in Computer Software Engineering**  
Islamic Azad University, Urmia Branch (2015 – 2020)
