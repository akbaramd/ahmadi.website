**Enter.UI** is a React component library I co-developed, built on **Material Design** principles. It is fully typed with TypeScript and published on npm for use in any React project.

## Motivation

Existing component libraries were either too opinionated about styling or too large for projects that needed just a solid, accessible foundation. Enter.UI was designed to be lean, well-typed, and easy to extend.

## Key Features

- **Material Design foundation** — consistent visual language based on Google's Material Design spec
- **Full TypeScript support** — every component is fully typed with strict interfaces
- **Accessible by default** — ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and focus management built in
- **RTL support** — components work correctly in both left-to-right and right-to-left layouts
- **Tree-shakeable** — import only what you use; bundle size stays minimal
- **Theming** — customizable design tokens for colors, spacing, and typography

## Components

The library includes form controls, navigation, layout primitives, feedback components (alerts, toasts, modals), and data display elements — everything needed to build a complete application UI.

## Technology

Built with React 18+, TypeScript, and CSS Modules. Published as an ESM/CJS package on npm with full type declarations.
